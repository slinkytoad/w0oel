# Club Profile

The Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is incorporated in Iowa as a non-profit organization dedicated to further the advancement of the amateur radio service in and around northeast Iowa through educational programs and public service. Emphasis will be placed on providing services to local governments and public service agencies in the rural areas that do not have backup systems in the event of natural or man-made disasters and to provide safety related communications for public events. We help and support several area county Emergency Management offices with their goals. In addition to our monthly meeting, we meet often for activities such as ARRL Field Day, a club holiday party, public service community events, and transmitter hunting exercised (fox hunts). We are continually looking for opportunities to make a difference in the lives of our members and in our community.

The Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is also recognized by the IRS as a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. Donations made to the club are tax deductible as defined by the tax law.
 
The Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is also affiliated with the ARRL, the national association for Amateur Radio.
