[{"content":"Club Profile The Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is incorporated in Iowa as a non-profit organization dedicated to further the advancement of the amateur radio service in and around northeast Iowa through educational programs and public service. Emphasis will be placed on providing services to local governments and public service agencies in the rural areas that do not have backup systems in the event of natural or man-made disasters and to provide safety related communications for public events. We help and support several area county Emergency Management offices with their goals. In addition to our monthly meeting, we meet often for activities such as ARRL Field Day, a club holiday party, public service community events, and transmitter hunting exercised (fox hunts). We are continually looking for opportunities to make a difference in the lives of our members and in our community.\nThe Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is also recognized by the IRS as a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. Donations made to the club are tax deductible as defined by the tax law.\nThe Rural Iowa Amateur Radio Club is also affiliated with the ARRL, the national association for Amateur Radio.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"","title":"About the Club"},{"content":"To add images you can use the following syntax:\n![This where you put the alt information](/uploads/self.webp) To add title, use the following syntax (\u0026lt;figure\u0026gt; element will be generated with \u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt;):\n![This where you put the alt information](/uploads/self.webp \u0026#34;This is where you put the title\u0026#34;) This is where you put the title Or from external sources:\n![This is where you put the alt](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520085601670-ee14aa5fa3e8 \u0026#34;This is the image title\u0026#34;) This is the image title ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/images/","summary":"Guide to adding images in Piko theme","title":"Adding Images"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;â€”\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
